James P Tabernathy ||| (The third) is the grandson of [[James P. Tabernathy]], and the current CEO and operator of the [[Tabernathy Washer & Fastener Company]]

He is only 26 years old, and was recently promoted from CVP to CEO after his father [[James P Tabernathy Jr]] died in an [unfortunate industrial accident]([[The Mine Accident of '67]]).

James is relatively well liked among the people of the town, though those among the [[Miner's Underground]] view him with some suspicion given his inexperience and young age.
