- We started with town creation. Sketching the picture of [[Silent Falls, USA]]
	- ### What keeps us separated from the outside world?
	  Silent falls is irrelevant. After the mining industry closed up, we didn't have anything to offer the world outside.
	- ### What keeps  connected with the outside world?
	  We host an [[Annual Fishing & Washer Festival]], at [[Lake Clearwater]]. It is what people in nearby towns think of first when they think of Silent Falls.
	- ### Who founded our town? And how do we choose to remember him?
	  It was founded by [[James P. Tabernathy]], and most things in the town are named after him. (Think like the Carnaegies in Pittsburgh). The town thinks of him largely uncritically as a wealthy and benefactor and industrialist.
	- ### Why was it founded here?
	  The town was originally just a small settlement in a mountain valley, but it blew up after the discovery of a rich coal vein in in the mountain, and the opening of the [[Silent Falls Coal Mine]]
	- ### What important figure from the town's history has been forgotten?
	  [[Susan Tabernathy]], the wife of James, has largely been forgotten by the locals of the town. However, she was the one who was responsible for the cutthroat business practices and massive success of both the [[Tabernathy Mining Group]] and the [[Tabernathy Washer & Fastener Company]].
	  
	  While everything in the town is named after her husband, she has a single bench in [[Tabernathy Square]] with her name on a plaque, next to a giant statue of a washer, and a smaller statue of her husband.
	- ### What iconic place do the townspeople identify with?
	  [[Tabernathy Square]] is the central hub of the town, where town hall is constructed. [[First Friday]] happens here every month. The square is dominated by [[The World's (2nd) Largest Washer]], and a large statue of James P Tabernathy
	- ### What forbidden place do we view with suspicion?
	  The [[Silent Falls Coal Mine]]. It's been barricaded and abandoned.
