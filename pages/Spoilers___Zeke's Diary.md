- The players might find [Zeke]([[Zeke Kamiski]])'s diary. It's a girl's diary from the Scholastic book fair that has been spray painted black. If you hold it at the right angle, you can see an embossed heart and lettering saying "My Secrets".
- It has a small lock on the front that seems stronger than it should be. It can be bypassed by either:
	- finding the key, (someone who knows them think of a place he keeps his secret objects.)
	- a DC15 Brawn check to break it open
	  when you break it open, you get a feeling like you're a fish and someone just tapped on the glass.
- In the diary you find:
	- Talking about the life he's going to live when he makes it out of Silent Falls
	- Notes about a [girl he's been talking to]([[Spoilers/Clara Ocotria-Green]]) through the payphone behind the [[Food Badger]]
